## üöÄ Complete Setup Guide for Beginners

> **üëã New to coding?** Don't worry! This guide will walk you through everything step-by-step. No prior programming experience needed.

### üìã What You'll Need First

Before we start, you need to install some basic tools on your computer:

#### Step A: Install Git (for downloading the code)

**Windows Users:**
1. Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Download Git for Windows  
3. Run the installer with default settings
4. After installation, you can right-click anywhere and see "Git Bash" - that's how you'll know it worked!

**Mac Users:**
1. Open "Terminal" (press Cmd+Space, type "terminal", press Enter)
2. Type: `git --version`
3. If Git is already installed, you'll see a version number
4. If not, macOS will prompt you to install Xcode Command Line Tools - click "Install"

**Linux Users:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git

# CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:  
sudo dnf install git
```

#### Step B: Install Python (the programming language this app uses)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** You need Python version 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12. **NOT 3.13 or higher** - it won't work!

**Windows Users:**
1. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. **Don't click the big download button!** Scroll down to find Python 3.12.x
3. Download and run the installer
4. **IMPORTANT:** Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
5. Test: Open Command Prompt (Win+R, type `cmd`) and type `python --version`

**Mac Users:**
1. First check what you have: Open Terminal and type `python3 --version`
2. If you see 3.13+, you need to install 3.12 instead:
   ```bash
   # Install Homebrew first (if you don't have it):
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   
   # Then install Python 3.12:
   brew install python@3.12
   ```

**Linux Users:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.12 python3.12-venv python3.12-dev

# CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:
sudo dnf install python3.12 python3.12-devel
```

## üîß Installing the TTS Application

Now that you have Git and Python installed, let's get the application running!

### Step 1: Download the Application Code

**What is "cloning"?** It means downloading all the code files to your computer.

**For Windows Users:**
1. Right-click on your Desktop  
2. Select "Git Bash Here"
3. In the black window that opens, copy and paste this command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/kitten_tts.git
   ```
4. Press Enter and wait for it to download
5. Type: `cd kitten_tts` and press Enter

**For Mac/Linux Users:**
1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to where you want the app (like Desktop):
   ```bash
   cd Desktop
   ```
3. Download the code:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/kitten_tts.git
   cd kitten_tts
   ```

**‚úÖ Success Check:** You should now see files like `README.md`, `requirements.txt` when you type `ls` (Mac/Linux) or `dir` (Windows)

### Step 2: Create a Safe Space for the App (Virtual Environment)

**What's a virtual environment?** Think of it as a separate folder where this app keeps all its specific requirements, so it doesn't mess with other software on your computer.

**Check Your Python Version First:**

**Windows Users:** 
```bash
python --version
```

**Mac/Linux Users:**
```bash
python3 --version
```

**You should see something like "Python 3.11.5" or "Python 3.12.1"**

**If you see Python 3.13+ or get an error:**
- Go back to Step B above and install Python 3.12
- Make sure you can run the version check successfully before continuing

**Create the Virtual Environment:**

**Windows Users:**
```bash
# If you have Python 3.12 installed:
py -3.12 -m venv venv

# Or if your default Python is correct (3.9-3.12):
python -m venv venv
```

**Mac Users:**
```bash
# If you installed Python 3.12 with Homebrew:
python3.12 -m venv venv

# Or if your default Python is correct:
python3 -m venv venv
```

**Linux Users:**
```bash
# If you installed Python 3.12:
python3.12 -m venv venv

# Or if your default Python is correct:
python3 -m venv venv
```

**‚úÖ Success Check:** You should now see a new folder called `venv` in your kitten_tts directory

### Step 3: Activate Your Virtual Environment

**What does "activate" mean?** It tells your computer to use the Python and packages from this special folder instead of your system's default ones.

**Windows Users:**
1. In your Git Bash or Command Prompt (make sure you're in the kitten_tts folder):
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. **Success:** Your command prompt should now start with `(venv)` - this means it worked!

**Mac/Linux Users:**
1. In Terminal (make sure you're in the kitten_tts folder):
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```  
2. **Success:** Your command prompt should now start with `(venv)` - this means it worked!

**Double-Check Your Python Version:**
```bash
python --version
```
**You should see Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12. If you see 3.13+, something went wrong - start over with Step 2.**

### Step 4: Install the App's Requirements

**What are dependencies?** These are other pieces of software that our app needs to work - like ingredients for a recipe.

**Copy and paste these commands one by one:**

1. **First, upgrade the installer tool:**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```
   *Wait for this to finish (you'll see "Successfully upgraded pip")*

2. **Install the main requirements:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_minimal.txt
   ```
   *This will take 2-5 minutes and show lots of text. That's normal! Wait for it to complete.*

3. **Install the high-quality voice engine (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   pip install kokoro
   ```
   *This might take another 2-3 minutes*

**‚úÖ Success Check:** If you see "Successfully installed" messages without any red error text, you're good to go!

### Step 5: Download Language Processing (Optional but Recommended)

**What's this for?** It helps the app understand English text better for more natural speech.

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```
*This downloads about 50MB and might take 1-2 minutes*

### Step 6: Start the Application! üöÄ

**The moment of truth! Let's run the app:**

```bash
python -m src.kitten_audiobook.ui.app
```

**What you should see:**
- Lots of text will appear (don't worry, this is normal!)
- Look for these important lines:
  ```
  INFO:root:‚úÖ Kokoro TTS loaded successfully  
  INFO:root:KittenTTS engine initialized
  * Running on local URL: http://127.0.0.1:7860
  ```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Don't close this window!** The app runs from here. Minimize it if needed.

### Step 7: Use the App in Your Web Browser

1. **Open your web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - any will work)
2. **Go to this address:** `http://localhost:7860`
3. **You should see a beautiful interface** with two tabs:
   - "üéôÔ∏è Text-to-Speech" - Convert any text to speech
   - "üìö PDF to Audiobook" - Convert PDF documents to audiobooks

### üéâ Test Your Setup

**Let's make sure everything works:**

1. **Click on the "üéôÔ∏è Text-to-Speech" tab**
2. **In the text box, type:** "Hello world, this is my new text to speech application!"
3. **Click the "üéôÔ∏è Synthesize Audio" button**
4. **Wait 5-10 seconds** (be patient!)
5. **You should hear a voice saying your text!** 

**üéä Congratulations! You've successfully set up the TTS application!**

### ‚úÖ Verify Installation

After starting the app, you should see:
```bash
* Running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7860
INFO:root:‚úÖ Kokoro TTS loaded successfully  
INFO:root:KittenTTS engine initialized
```

**Test the setup:**
1. Open http://localhost:7860 in your browser
2. Go to "üéôÔ∏è Text-to-Speech" tab
3. Enter "Hello, this is a test" in the text box
4. Click "üéôÔ∏è Synthesize Audio"
5. You should hear generated speech - **setup complete!** üéâ

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Troubleshooting (Advanced Users)

### Common Issues

**1. Python Version Compatibility Issues**
```bash
# Check your Python version first
python --version

# If you see Python 3.13+, you need to use a compatible version:
# macOS: brew install python@3.12 && python3.12 -m venv venv
# Linux: sudo apt install python3.12-venv && python3.12 -m venv venv
# Windows: Download Python 3.12 from python.org

# Always verify after creating venv:
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows  
python --version  # Should show 3.9.x - 3.12.x
```

**2. ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'gradio'**
```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements_minimal.txt
```
